0.030     2013-10-12 22:09:46Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - xt_mode must be used in [Test::Compile] when xt/ tests run before

          - fix unit tests that broke when Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InstallGuide
            1.200001 was released (which retroactively broke the 0.027
            release)

0.027     2013-09-27 03:50:26Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - minted dists once again use the default 'installer' value (now

          - added missing required prereqs, and now properly skipping relevant
            tests when optional dependencies are not installed (with guard

0.024     2013-09-19 02:29:14Z (Karen Etheridge)

            dependency that we can now remove from here
          - vim modeline added to .pm in minted dist
          - default 'installer' backend now defaults to 'none', forcing

            ModuleBuildTiny, the previous default (RT#88642)

0.023     2013-09-11 01:43:22Z (Karen Etheridge)

0.022     2013-09-10 01:48:53Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - warnings tests bypassed during installation, to prevent
            installation issues in the presence of deprecation warnings from
            upstream dependencies (in this case, via Moose 2.1100) - and
            similar change made in test generated via minting profile
          - bumped dependency version for [Test::PodSpelling] and wordlists
          - bumped dependency on Dist::Zilla, for yaml encoding fixes

          - now supporting dists hosted elsewhere than github (currently
            gitmo, p5sagit, or other), via the 'server' option
          - Test::Version now runs in strict mode
          - generated clean-namespaces.t test now skips ::Conflicts module
          - [Test::Kwalitee] now included in bundle, rather than adding it
            into the minted dist.ini separately

0.018     2013-08-16 05:11:06Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - now using [PromptIfStale] to ensure the plugin bundle is always
            the latest version, and all plugins are checked at release time
          - bring back [Test::CPAN::Changes], now that the spec has become a
            bit more reasonable (removed since v0.015)
          - Changes entries are now made with times in UTC, with a trailing
            'Z' rather than the CLDR 'ZZZZ' format code

0.017     2013-08-04 09:12:17 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - update minimum version of perl required, re syntax used in
            templates applied during minting
          - inject a forced dependency on a fixed CPAN::Meta::Check
          - skip pluginbundle tests if .git dir is not present (too many

          - injected compile test now also checks files in examples/

            compatibility with Module::Build::Tiny

0.013     2013-07-28 16:59:41 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - inserts --ignore-dir line into .ackrc at build time
          - when releasing this pluginbundle, dist.ini is edited (and
            committed) to force a dependency on the newly-released version, and
            all other local dist.inis using this bundle are also edited
            (without committing)
          - issue tracking is disabled in newly-created github repositories

0.012     2013-07-16 18:32:35 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - do not require trial versions of [Test::Compile], allowing

0.011     2013-07-05 17:59:57 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)

0.009     2013-06-20 10:18:12 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - 'installer' now defaults to ModuleBuildTiny
          - (experimental) namespaces-are-clean release test added to minting
            profile, although this won't pass for many types of dists as many
            things are sloppy about modifying the package stash

0.008     2013-06-11 15:59:23 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix bad templating in minted module
          - during minting, push the initial commit to github after creating
            the remote

0.007     2013-05-29 18:48:34 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - minting profile updates:
            - extra kwalitee tests enabled by default
            - test now has 'use <main module>;', prefers done_testing,
              and now fails, rather than not compiling
            - main module now avoids the list transformer where it breaks pod
              coverage tests; includes more template pod
          - config option added for changing the installer backend (still
            defaults to MakeMaker, for now)

0.006     2013-05-10 17:06:41 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - support dropped for directly passing stopwords via a mvp argument
            -- it's easier to just use a directive right in pod (and they can
            be added via ConfigSlicer too, if needed)
          - minting process now prompts to create a repository on github
          - alter max_target_perl setting for *this dist itself only* to
            commit to run on 5.16.3+, not 5.8.8+
          - the version of Dist::Zilla used to build this distribution is
            injected as a develop prerequisite for users of the plugin bundle
          - the version of this bundle used to mint a dist is set as the
            minimum version for subsequent builds of the dist
          - after release, the github repository is updated with the
            distribution's abstract as its description, and the metacpan page
            as its homepage.

0.005     2013-04-28 08:47:40 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)

            RT#84904, RT#84905)

0.004     2013-04-26 20:56:11 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix missing .gitignore in minted dists
          - [-Encoding] podweaver plugin added to this distribution and
            minted dists
          - extra stopwords added, after disabling my local aspell dictionary
          - Pod::Weaver plugins used in this bundle are added as runtime
            prerequisites

0.003     2013-04-21 10:22:48 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - now building ourself with ourselves, [@Author::ETHER].
          - [Test::UnusedVars] added
          - RT mail link cleaned up
          - bump prereqs for Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover,
            Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes
          - document the multiple mechanisms for adding stopwords (and add the
            [-Stopwords] weaver plugin, which seems to be needed sometimes)

0.002     2013-04-14 15:40:08 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - do not index our profiles/, to avoid its contents from showing up
            under "Documentation" on metacpan
          - users of [@Author::ETHER] can now -remove plugins

0.001     2013-04-14 13:52:50 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Initial release.
