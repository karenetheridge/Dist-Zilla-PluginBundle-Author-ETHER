Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Author-ETHER

{{$NEXT}}
          - new 'plugin_prereq_phase' and 'plugin_prereq_relationship'
            configuration options, which control whether and how to inject
            plugins used by this bundle into distribution prerequisites

0.132     2017-12-13 07:15:09Z

            Betts!)
          - added .travis.yml to minting profile
          - plugins used by the bundle are now injected into develop-suggests
            prerequisites, rather than develop-requires, so Travis no longer
            feels obliged to install them when testing the built distribution

0.130     2017-08-28 01:13:46Z
          - fix test that is broken with older [CopyFilesFromRelease]

          - [@Git::VersionManager] and [MetaProvides::Update] are moved off to
            their own distribution, Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-VersionManager

0.129     2017-08-21 04:45:42Z
          - fix a new test to avoid triggering the "looks like you're
            installing from cpan, rather than building a distribution in the
            repository" heuristic when using Dist::Zilla (e.g. on older perls)

0.128     2017-08-16 23:39:44Z
          - version extraction and updating plugins now fully extracted out
            into their own plugin bundle, [@Git::VersionManager], to be soon
            released in its own distribution

            formats
          - bump up prereq for [VerifyPhases] to get share_map fix
          - added [CheckMetaResources]

0.122     2017-02-03 01:27:46Z

            is not available (see github #5)
          - silence "no bash" warnings during testing
          - respect necessary prereqs for configs provided by plugin roles

0.119     2016-09-04 22:48:25Z
          - Module::Metadata is no longer used as a test prereq (via
            [Test::ReportPrereqs]) if ExtUtils::MakeMaker is the sole
            installer, to avoid adding possibly-unwanted prereqs (Graham Knop)

0.118     2016-08-07 21:59:49Z

          - eliminate remaining uses of List::MoreUtils

          - add Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::ETHER and use it in my dzil

          - no longer scans inc/ for configure_requires minimum perl version
          - generated CONTRIBUTING file now mentions the existence of a TODO

            distribution's tests, and in newly-minted distributions
          - add 'default' minting profile, which is the same as 'github'

          - use [Git::Describe]'s new on_package_line feature

            with loaded modules
          - copy_file_from_release option now appends to, rather than

            [MakeMaker] version 5.020

0.070     2014-08-16 18:48:19Z

            (github) CPAN-API/metacpan-web#1270 instead.
          - order contributors by number of commits, descending
          - no longer adding an $AUTHORITY variable to modules, as nothing
            (save Class::MOP, Moose and Moo) has ever used it - this also
            avoids shifting our line numbers by 3

0.069     2014-08-07 02:44:38Z

          - README.pod is now generated only in the repository, after
            release, so it never shows up in the shipped dist
          - include a default .mailmap in the minted dist; invite the user to
            update .mailmap if the contributor data is not quite right
          - avoid errors from in XS-based distributions where a token Makefile.PL
            is included and we try to generate our own over top
          - more directories added to no_index
          - now instead of installing release with [InstallRelease], switch to
            [Run::AfterRelease] with an author-specific PAUSE URL, to help out
            cpanm-reporter
          - adjust the command that updates the .latest symlink, to account
            for @#$!@#$ incompatibilities between implementations of `ln`

0.067     2014-07-25 01:09:13Z

          - internally-hardcoded extra arguments to be passed to optional

          - minimum perl version really really fixed now

            better suited to address these sorts of issues
          - Makefile.PL now checks for 'git' command, so we can get NA reports
            for every smoker that tried to look at us (before attempting to
            install all the prerequisites)
          - customized minting output if the dist is a Dist::Zilla plugin

            customization

            Config::MVP::Assembler::WithBundles::_add_bundle_contents

0.047     2014-01-14 05:34:39Z
          - adjusted plugin order so [PkgVersion] gets a chance to insert into
            the first blank line of the package (new in 5.010) before other
            modules insert their code lines
          - pod removed from in the middle of source is now replaced with a
            commented-out version of itself, to avoid altering line numbers

          - ensure that .pod files are also eligible for indexing
          - minting profile switched to using a dist sharedir to store

          - fix config for [Git::Commit], to properly commit files that were

          - more tweaks to CONTRIBUTING text

            1.200001 was released (which retroactively broke the 0.027
            release)

0.027     2013-09-27 03:50:26Z
          - minted dists once again use the default 'installer' value (now
            [MakeMaker::Fallback] and [ModuleBuildTiny], since 0.025)
          - added missing required prereqs, and now properly skipping relevant
            tests when optional dependencies are not installed (with guard

          - vim modeline added to .pm in minted dist
          - default 'installer' backend now defaults to 'none', forcing

0.022     2013-09-10 01:48:53Z

            installation issues in the presence of deprecation warnings from

            similar change made in test generated via minting profile

          - generated clean-namespaces.t test now skips ::Conflicts module

          - now using [PromptIfStale] to ensure the plugin bundle is always
            the latest version, and all plugins are checked at release time
          - bring back [Test::CPAN::Changes], now that the spec has become a
            bit more reasonable (removed since v0.015)
          - Changes entries are now made with times in UTC, with a trailing
            'Z' rather than the CLDR 'ZZZZ' format code

          - update minimum version of perl required, re syntax used in
            templates applied during minting
          - inject a forced dependency on a fixed CPAN::Meta::Check
          - skip pluginbundle tests if .git dir is not present (too many

          - added basic tests for the pluginbundle and minter

0.013     2013-07-28 23:59:41Z
          - inserts --ignore-dir line into .ackrc at build time
          - when releasing this pluginbundle, dist.ini is edited (and
            committed) to force a dependency on the newly-released version, and
            all other local dist.inis using this bundle are also edited
            (without committing)
          - issue tracking is disabled in newly-created github repositories

0.012     2013-07-17 01:32:35Z

          - 'installer' now defaults to ModuleBuildTiny
          - (experimental) namespaces-are-clean release test added to minting
            profile, although this won't pass for many types of dists as many
            things are sloppy about modifying the package stash

0.008     2013-06-11 22:59:23Z
          - fix bad templating in minted module
          - during minting, push the initial commit to github after creating
            the remote

0.007     2013-05-30 01:48:34Z
          - minting profile updates:
            - extra kwalitee tests enabled by default
            - test now has 'use <main module>;', prefers done_testing,
              and now fails, rather than not compiling
            - main module now avoids the list transformer where it breaks pod
              coverage tests; includes more template pod
          - config option added for changing the installer backend (still
            defaults to MakeMaker, for now)

0.006     2013-05-11 00:06:41Z
          - support dropped for directly passing stopwords via a mvp argument
            -- it's easier to just use a directive right in pod (and they can
            be added via ConfigSlicer too, if needed)
          - minting process now prompts to create a repository on github
          - alter max_target_perl setting for *this dist itself only* to
            commit to run on 5.16.3+, not 5.8.8+
          - the version of Dist::Zilla used to build this distribution is
            injected as a develop prerequisite for users of the plugin bundle
          - the version of this bundle used to mint a dist is set as the
            minimum version for subsequent builds of the dist
          - after release, the github repository is updated with the
            distribution's abstract as its description, and the metacpan page
            as its homepage.

          - fix missing .gitignore in minted dists
          - [-Encoding] podweaver plugin added to this distribution and
            minted dists
          - extra stopwords added, after disabling my local aspell dictionary
          - Pod::Weaver plugins used in this bundle are added as runtime
            prerequisites

          - now building ourself with ourselves, [@Author::ETHER].
          - [Test::UnusedVars] added
          - RT mail link cleaned up
          - bump prereqs for Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::PluginRemover,
            Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes
          - document the multiple mechanisms for adding stopwords (and add the
            [-Stopwords] weaver plugin, which seems to be needed sometimes)

          - do not index our profiles/, to avoid its contents from showing up
            under "Documentation" on metacpan
          - users of [@Author::ETHER] can now -remove plugins

0.001     2013-04-14 20:52:50Z
          - Initial release, incorporating the minting profile that I had been
            using locally in ~/.dzil/profiles/github.
